# Introduction

This report aims to explore gender equality from both global and Australian perspectives. Globally, this report analyses the gender difference in labour participation and financial inclusion, then it explores the role played by gender in Australia regarding job placements, unemployment rate and the average offender rate.

There are seven data sets used in this report, retrieved from The World Bank, Australian Bureau of Statistics, Department of Education and Sustainable Development Goals of Australian Government. All data sets falls under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License and Creative Commons Attribution License Australia, both allow them to be used for analysis of this report.

This report is done solely for the purpose of analysis, no offence or sexism is intended.

This section compares and contracts the gender differences regarding labour participation from global perspectives between 2000 and 2019. There are two aspects being considered as indicators:

- Percentage of female labour force
- Percentage of contributing family workers

Data is selected and filtered to contain only relevant variables for analysis from 2000 to 2019, countries with over 80% missing values are removed as well.

## Percentage of Female Labour Force

```{r}
labour_force <- labour %>% 
  select("country", "year", "labour_force_f_per_of_tot_lf")
```

Percentage of female labour force is the percentage of active female workers in total labour force, which are people who are 15 years old or older and active in labour force.

Figure \@ref(fig:lf) demonstrates that in the Middle East & North Africa, only around 20% of the total labour force are females, which is the lowest among all regions. South Asia has the second lowest percentage of female labour force, about 25% of labour force were females in 2000, and the figure dropped to just above 20% in 2019. On the other hand, the percentage of female labour force in Latin America & Caribbean increased from about 38% in 2000 to above 40% in 2019. Around 45% of the labour force are female in the rest of other regions, which is reasonably close to the ratio of male and female population.  

The percentage of female labour force has not changed much from 2000 for majority of the regions in the world except South Asia, where the percentage of female labour force experienced a decrease between 2005 to 2012. 

```{r lf, fig.cap='Changes in Percentage of Female Labour Force'}

                        "Sub-Saharan Africa")) %>% 
  rename("region" = country) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = as.numeric(year), 
             y = labour_force_f_per_of_tot_lf,

         "region" = country) %>% 
  select(region, `labour_force_female(%)`)
```

```{r}
labour_force_2019$region[which(labour_force_2019$region == "United States")] = "USA"
labour_force_2019$region[which(labour_force_2019$region == "United Kingdom")] = "UK"
labour_force_2019$region[which(labour_force_2019$region == "Russian Federation")] = "Russia"
labour_force_2019$region[which(labour_force_2019$region == "Iran, Islamic Rep.")] = "Iran"
labour_force_2019$region[which(labour_force_2019$region == "Egypt, Arab Rep.")] = "Egypt"
labour_force_2019$region[which(labour_force_2019$region == "Congo, Rep.")] = "Democratic Republic of the Congo"
labour_force_2019$region[which(labour_force_2019$region == "Venezuela, RB")] = "Venezuela"
labour_force_2019$region[which(labour_force_2019$region == "Yemen, Rep.")] = "Yemen"

```

```{r}
map <- world_map %>% 
  left_join(labour_force_2019, 
            by = "region")
```

As in 2019, the percentage of female labour force around the world are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:maplf). It is obvious that females are not participating in the labour force as much as in other regions in the Middle East & North Africa and South Asia, there is no doubt that gender plays a significant role regarding labour force in these areas. Gender does not seem to be an issue in the more developed regions such as Europe and North America. 

```{r maplf, fig.cap="Percentage of Female Labour Force in 2019", fig.width=10}
ggplot(map, aes(map_id = region, fill = `labour_force_female(%)`))+
  geom_map(map = map,  color = "white")+
  expand_limits(x = map$long, y = map$lat)+
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "C") +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(-156, 180), ylim = c(-56, 80)) +

  theme_light() + 
  theme(panel.background = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank()) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 75, hjust = 1))
```

## Percentage of Contributing Family Workers

```{r}
contribute_fm <- labour %>% 
  select("country","year",
         "contributing_m_per_of_m_pop",
         "contributing_f_per_of_f_pop") %>% 
  filter(country %in% c("Central Europe and the Baltics",
                        "East Asia & Pacific",
                        "Europe & Central Asia",
                        "European Union",
                        "Latin America & Caribbean",
                        "Middle East & North Africa",
                        "North America",
                        "South Asia",
                        "Sub-Saharan Africa")) %>% 
  mutate("contributing_dif" = contributing_m_per_of_m_pop - contributing_f_per_of_f_pop)

```

Contributing family workers are those workers who are counted in the labour force, reported themselves as 'self-employed', and works in establishments that are operated by a related person living in the same household. Workers falls under this category are not necessarily paid as in regular jobs.

Figure \@ref(fig:cfm) illustrate the difference in percentage of contributing family workers between male and female, it is calculated by percentage of male minus percentage of female. Except in North America, where the difference is almost zero, the difference in percentage is negative in all of the regions, which suggests that there are more female contributing family workers than male. The differences is getting smaller over the years, which shows that gender equality has been improving overall.

```{r cfm, fig.cap='Difference Between Male and Female (Contributing Family Workers'}
contribute_fm %>% 
  rename("region" = country) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = as.numeric(year), y = contributing_dif, colour = region)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Difference (in %)") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Paired") +
  theme_light() + 
  theme(panel.background = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank()) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 75, hjust = 1))
```

According to Table \@ref(tab:cfmdif) the difference in percentage of contributing family workers is the largest in South Asia (25.4%), given that the percentage of female labour force in the region is the second lowest in the world, it is likely that among those active female workers, a significant number of them are actually contributing family workers. The difference in percentage of male and female contributing family workers are also quite large in East Asia & Pacific, Middle East & North Africa, and Sub-Saharan Africa.

```{r cfmdif}
contribute_fm %>%
  rename("region" = country) %>%
  filter(year == 2019) %>% 
  select(region, contributing_dif) %>% 
  arrange(contributing_dif) %>% 
  kable(col.names = c("Region", "Difference Between Male and Female (%)"),
        align = "c",
        caption = "Table X - Difference in Percentage of Contributing Family Workers in 2019",
        digits = 2) %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))
```

Overall, gender does play a significant role in labour participation, particularly in the Middle East & North Africa and South Asia, it does not have as much effect in the more developed regions such as European Union and North America.

Data is filtered with time frame and variables of interest, column names are renamed, dataset is also formatted in long format for easy access.

## Financial Inclusion Legislations

In this section, we were interested in the following indicators:
1. A woman can open a bank account in the same way as a man (1=yes; 0=no)
2. A woman can register a business in the same way as a man (1=yes; 0=no)
3. A woman can sign a contract in the same way as a man (1=yes; 0=no)
4. Do men and married women have equal rights to inherit (1=yes; 0=no)
5. Whether the law mandate equal remuneration for work of equal value (1=yes; 0=no)

In order to compare between countries, we gave equal weight to each of the above indicators and calculated financial inclusion score, which adds up the above 5 indicators for each country. The score ranges between 0 and 5. 

```{r}
data1 <- data_zb_tidy %>% 
  rename(Country_code = `Country Code`) %>% 
    mutate(score = can_open_account +
          can_reg_business + 
         can_sign_contract +
         equal_to_inherit + 
         equal_remuneration_by_law) %>%
  select(Country_name, 
         Country_code,
         Year, 
         score) %>% 
  na.omit()

data1$Country_name[which(data1$Country_name == "United States")] = "USA"
data1$Country_name[which(data1$Country_name == "United Kingdom")] = "UK"
data1$Country_name[which(data1$Country_name == "Russian Federation")] = "Russia"
data1$Country_name[which(data1$Country_name == "Iran, Islamic Rep.")] = "Iran"
data1$Country_name[which(data1$Country_name == "Congo, Rep.")] = "Democratic Republic of the Congo"
data1$Country_name[which(data1$Country_name == "Venezuela, RB")] = "Venezuela"
data1$Country_name[which(data1$Country_name == "Yemen, Rep.")] = "Yemen"
data1$Country_name[which(data1$Country_name == "Egypt, Arab Rep.")] = "Egypt"
```

```{r table1-zb}
data1 %>% 
 filter(Year %in% c("2000", "2020")) %>% 
  group_by(score, Year) %>% 
  #summarise(percent = 100* n()/nrow(Country_name))
  tally() %>% 
  mutate(percentage = n/189*100) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = Year,
              values_from = c(n, percentage)) %>%
  select(score, n_2000, percentage_2000, n_2020, percentage_2020) %>% 
  kable(col.names = c("Score", 
                      "Number of countries in 2000",
                      "Percentage in 2000",
                      "Number of countries in 2020",
                      "Percentage in 2020"),
        align = "c",
        caption = "Financial inclusion score of countries in 2000 and 2020",
        digits = 2) %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))

```

Table \@ref(tab:table1-zb) summarises the countries by financial inclusion score in 2000 and 2020. In 2000, only 17% of the countries had the score of 5 while the percentage increased to 36.5% in 20 years period. But in 2020, 17.4% of the countries in total had the score of 3 or less.

Figure \@ref(fig:plot1zb), visualizes the score on the map. The lighter color indicates the higher financial inclusion score, which means men and women have equal right in terms of law.It is clear how the legislation regarding gender equality progressed in 20 years period. Alas, it seems that there is still some room to improvement in some regions.


```{r plot1zb, fig.cap="Financial inclusion score in 2000 and 2020"}
world_map <- map_data("world")
ww <- world_map %>% 
  left_join(data1, by = c("region" = "Country_name")) 

ww %>% 
  filter(Year %in% c("2000", "2020")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(long, lat, group = group))+
  geom_polygon(aes(fill = score), color = "white")+

```

## Financial Inclusion by Statistic

In this section, the following variables have been chosen to explore:

1. Saved any money in the past year, female (% age 15+)
2. Saved any money in the past year, male (% age 15+)
3. Borrowed any money in the past year, female (% age 15+)
4. Borrowed any money in the past year, male (% age 15+)
5. Financial institution account, female (% age 15+)
6. Financial institution account, male (% age 15+)

Figure \@ref(fig:plot2zb) is a density plot to by sex. By 2017 statistic, more men seem to have both saved and borrowed any money in the last 1 year period. It suggests that there was a considerable gap in financial inclusion.

```{r plot2zb, fig.cap=" Density of saving and borrowing percentage, compared by sex in 2017"}
data2 <- data_zb_tidy %>%

         male = borrowed_male) %>%

```

Figure \@ref(fig:plot3zb) plots the proportion of individuals who have an account at financial institutions (% of age 15+) grouped countries by the World Bank's income level classification by gender. For higher income countries, almost 100 percent of the population over 15 years old have an account at a financial institution, while for low income countries the figure is just above 50% and the significant gap is present between gender.

```{r plot3zb, fig.cap="Percentage of population who have an account at Financial institution by income group in 2017"}
data3 <- data_zb_tidy %>% 
  left_join(data_income, by = c("Country_name" = "Economy")) %>% 
  rename("Income_group" = `Income group`,
         "Female" = account_at_FI_female,
         "Male" = account_at_FI_male) %>%

This section compares and contrasts how females and males are employed across different states in Australia, including job Vacancies, employment type and job positions.

## Unemployment Groups

In this section, all the important variables for the analysis are being filtered, wrangled and then being stored into a variable called "unemp_group". 

```{r}
Job_placement%>%
  select(Gender,State,Ue_group,Job_placement_date)%>%
  filter(Gender == c("Male","Female"))%>%
  group_by(Gender,State,Ue_group)%>%
  count()-> unemp_group

```

```{r plot1rh, fig.height=6, fig.cap="Employment groups: Males v/s Females"}
unemp_group%>%
   ggplot(aes(x=State,y = n)) + 
   geom_col(aes(fill = State)) + 
   xlab ("States") + ylab("Number of people employed") +
   facet_grid(Ue_group~Gender, scale = "free") + # change to "facet_wrap(~Gender, scale = "free")"     
   scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Accent") +
   theme_light() + 
   theme(panel.background = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank()) +
   theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 75, hjust = 1))



#U_EG + transition_states(Ue_group,
                       # transition_length = 2,
                       # state_length = 2) + 
                       # ease_aes('cubic-in-out') +
                       # ggtitle("Unemployment Group, {closest_state}")
  
```

Figure \@ref(fig:plot1rh) uses a variable called "ue_group" for its construction which has several groups, the names of which are:

* Under 12 months 
* 12 to 23 months 
* 24 to 59 months
* 60 + months 

These demonstrate how long a candidate was unemployed for before they got placed with an employer, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:plot1rh), in Australia more males, across all groups & states, got employed than females. 

## Vacancies Filled Across Industries

In this section, all the important variables for the analysis is being filtered and wrangled and stored into a variable called "Industry_gender". 

```{r}

Job_placement%>%
  select(Gender,Emp_industry)%>%
  filter(Gender == c("Male","Female"))%>%
  group_by(Emp_industry,Gender)%>%
  count(Emp_industry)-> Industry_gender

```

```{r plot2rh, fig.cap="Vacancies filled across different industries in 2018"}

Industry_gender%>%
  ggplot(aes(y = Emp_industry , x = n, fill = Gender)) +
  geom_col(position = "fill") +
  theme_light() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Paired") + 
  xlab("% Males and Females") + 
  ylab("Employer Industry")
  
```

There are a lot of vacancies for Male dominated industries in Figure \@ref(fig:plot2rh) which somewhat explains why more males have been placed, except for a few industries like Education and training, Administrative and Support Services etc. 

To say that more males are being placed just because there are more male vacancies would be a long shot. The reason for that is this data-set is limited to the year 2018, there could have simply been more vacancies for males in 2018. Maybe the years before or after 2018, had more female vacancies so no conlcusion regarding to the long term can be made just from this data-set.

## Employment Type

In this section, all the important variables for the analysis are being filtered and wrangled and stored into a variable called "Job_type". 

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

Job_placement%>%
  select(Gender,Vacancy_desc,State)%>%
  filter(Gender == c("Male","Female"))%>%
  group_by(Gender,Vacancy_desc,State)%>%
  count()%>%
  summarise(totals = sum(n)) -> Job_type

Job_type%>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = Gender,
              values_from = totals)%>%
  mutate(average = mean(Male+Female)) -> Job_type_w

Job_type_w%>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c("Male","Female"),
               names_to = "Gender",
               values_to = "Totals") -> Job_type_l

```

```{r plot3rh, fig.cap="Employment Type: Casual Position"}

Job_type_l%>%
  filter(Vacancy_desc == "Casual position                                   ")%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = State, y = Totals)) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = State, xend = State, y = average, yend = Totals), color = "grey") +
  geom_point(color = "orange") + facet_wrap(~Gender) +
  geom_hline(yintercept =16796.750, colour = "orange") +
  theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
        panel.border = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x = element_blank()) +
  theme_light() + 
  xlab("States") + ylab("Total number of people employed")

```

The orange line in Figure \@ref(fig:plot3rh) represents average number of people employed for casual‚Äù position across all states in Australia. Average number of people employed in 2018, for casual position is 16796.750. Females across all states in Australia fall below this number where as the situation doesn't seem too bad for males, they seem to do better in VIC, NSW AND QLD. It is obvious how more males are preferred for casual positions as compared with females. 

```{r plot4rh, fig.cap="Employment Type: Full time, greater than 35h p/w"}

Job_type_l%>%
  filter(Vacancy_desc == "Full time, greater than 35h p/w                   ")%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = State, y = Totals)) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = State, xend = State, y = average, yend = Totals), color = "grey") +
  geom_point(color = "purple") + facet_wrap(~Gender) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 3891.375, colour = "purple") +
  theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
        panel.border = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x = element_blank()) +
  theme_light()+
  xlab("States") +ylab("Total number of people employed")

```

The purple line in \@ref(fig:plot4rh) represents average number of people employed for ‚ÄúFull time, greater than 35h p/w‚Äù across all states in Australia which is is 3891.375. It again shows that females across all states in Australia fall below this number while males again seem to do better in VIC, NSW AND QLD. 

```{r plot5rh, fig.cap="Employment Type: Part time, less than 35h p/w"}

Job_type_l%>%
  filter(Vacancy_desc == "Part time, less than 35h p/w                      ")%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = State, y = Totals)) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = State, xend = State, y = average, yend = Totals), color = "grey") +
  geom_point(color = "maroon") + facet_wrap(~Gender) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 2850.875, colour = "maroon") +
  theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
        panel.border = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x = element_blank()) +
  theme_light()+
  xlab("States") + ylab("Total number of people employed")

```

The Maroon line in Figure \@ref(fig:plot5rh) represents average number of people employed for ‚ÄúPart time, less than 35h p/w‚Äù position across all states in Australia which is 2850.875. This is where things take an interesting turn as we can see females are preferred for this role in NSW and VIC, same states which favor Males more for Casual and full time roles. Both Males and females seem to do better than the average in QLD, however males are again preferred for this role.

# üîç  The Influence of Gender and Age on Unemployment rate in Australia.(2000-2017)

This section discusses the relationship between unemployment and gender/age. 

The data is cleaned according to different gender and age group, including sum unemployment rate for each year for females and males that can help compare the total trend for each gender in various age groups. The data sets are also converted to longer form and split into month ~ percentage and computed the sum. It is also filtered and selected to retain the Month and age cohorts needed. 'Females 65 and over unemployment rate (%)' in the data frame is also converted to numeric for analysis.

As Figure \@ref(fig:plot1cg) shown above, the unemployment rate of males is higher than females in general, except between 2006 to 2008 (the global economic crisis) and 2010 to 2011. According to Department of Education, Skills and Employment(2019), there are more males in the labour force, and in turn explains the overall higher unemployment.

           "55-64" = "Males 55-64 unemployment rate (%)", 
           "65+" = "Males 65 and over unemployment rate (%)")) %>%

             names_to = "age_cohorts",
             values_to = "percentage") 

male <- mutate(males1, "Gender" = "M")

female <- mutate(females1, "Gender" = "F")

male_female <- full_join(male, female)
  
```

```{r}
write.csv(male_female, "Data_cleaned/male_female.csv")

```{r plot2cg, fig.cap = "Unemployment Rate for Different Age Groups", warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

    scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Paired")+
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 75, hjust = 1)) +
    facet_wrap(~ Month) 
```

As in Figure \@ref(fig:plot1cg), the distribution of unemployment rate between 2006 and 2008 were different from most other years in the data, therefore, a separate plot is created to explore the unemployment rate by gender and age. 

Figure \@ref(fig:plot2cg) demonstrates that during the financial crisis, gender no longer plays a significant role in terms of unemployment rate, age seems to be the key factor. Both female and male in age group of 15-24 have much higher unemployment rate compare with other age groups, a potential reason could be that people of this age group are more likely to be employed in retail or hospitality industries, which were most impacted by the financial crisis. In addition, people aged between 15 to 24 tend to occupy a higher proportion in the total labour force, and therefore higher unemployment rate (Parliament of Australia,2018).

As for all of the age groups in general during financial crisis, the unemployment rate for male and female does not seem to have much difference.

## The Total Number of Offences Committed by Male and Female in Australia

```{r crime1-my, fig.cap = "Number of Offences by Gender", message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
f_aus <- read_csv(here::here("Data_cleaned/f_offenders_aus.csv")) %>% 
  rename(offence = offence_female) %>% 
  mutate(gender = "F")

m_aus <- read_csv(here::here("Data_cleaned/m_offenders_aus.csv")) %>% 
  rename(offence = offence_male) %>% 
  mutate(gender = "M")

offenders_aus <- merge(f_aus, m_aus, all = TRUE) %>% 
  subset(select = c(offence:gender)) %>% 
  mutate(year = as.factor(year))

offenders_aus$offence <- gsub("[[:digit:]]", "", offenders_aus$offence) %>% 
  str_trim()

offenders_aus %>% group_by(year, gender) %>% 
  summarise(count = sum(count)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year,
             y = count,
             fill = gender)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Accent") +
  theme_light() + 
   theme(panel.background = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank()) +
   theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 75, hjust = 1))

```

As the figure \@ref(fig:crime1-my) shown above, there were significantly more offences committed by male than female between 2008 to 2019, but a downward trend emerged in 2012. The high unemployment rate for male in \@ref(fig:plot1cg) could be one of the contributors for this. The number of offences committed by female were similar in each year. 

## Different Types of Offences Committed by Male and Female

```{r crime2my, fig.height = 4, fig.cap = "Type of Offences by Gender", message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
offenders_aus %>% group_by(offence, year, gender) %>% 
  summarise(count = sum(count)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year,
             y = count,
             fill = gender)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Accent") +
  facet_wrap(~offence, ncol = 4, 
             labeller = label_wrap_gen(width = 30)) +
  theme_light() + 
   theme(panel.background = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank()) +
   theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 75, hjust = 1)) +
  theme(strip.text.x = element_text(size = 7)) +
  ggtitle("Type of Offences by Gender")

```

It is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:crime2my) that acts intended to cause injury, illicit drug offence, public order offence and theft were the top 4 offences among all the offences reported during 2008 to 2019, and male was the predominant offender, particularly in the acts intended to cause injury, illicit drug offence, public order offence.


## The Total Numbers of Offences Committed by Male and Female in Differnt Age Groups

```{r crime3-my, fig.height = 4, fig.cap = "Offences by Gender and Age", message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
f_age <- read_csv(here::here("Data_cleaned/f_offenders_aus_age.csv")) %>% 
  rename(age = female_age) %>% 
  mutate(gender = "F")

m_age <- read_csv(here::here("Data_cleaned/m_offenders_aus_age.csv")) %>% 
  rename(age = male_age) %>% 
  mutate(gender = "M")

offenders_aus_age <- merge(f_age, m_age, all = TRUE) %>% 
  subset(select = c(age:gender)) %>% 
  mutate(year = as.character(year))

offenders_aus_age%>% group_by(age, year, gender) %>% 
  summarise(count = sum(count)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year,
             y = count,
             fill = gender)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Accent") +
  facet_wrap(~age, ncol = 4) +
  theme_light() + 
   theme(panel.background = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank()) +
   theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 75, hjust = 1)) +
  ggtitle("Offences by Gender and Age")
```

Figure \@ref(fig:crime3-my) reflects that within all age groups, male was also the predominant offender, youth in particular, age between 15-24 years old was the highest offenders in Australia follow by the age group of 25-29 years and 30-34 years, but there was a clear downward trend in after 2009. This could be due to the high unemployment rate for male between 15-24 years old shown in Figure \@ref(fig:plot2cg). The total number of offences committed by female were more or less the same in each age group.


# Conclusion

In conclusion, gender still plays a significant role both globally and in Australia in terms of labour participation, financial inclusion, job placement, unemployment as well as offence rate. Females still struggle to be equally treated in labour force, accessing financial facilities, as well as in job placements. However, in terms of offence rate in Australia, males seem to be more likely to be the predominant offender as per recorded in the data used.

In general, the differences caused by gender is gradually decreasing over the years, but there is still a long way to go to achieve gender equality.

The findings drawn in the report are solely based on the data sets being used, and only for the period of time recorded in the data sets. The conclusions could be biased due to the limited number of data sets and time period, as well as the accuracy of values recorded in the original data sets.
